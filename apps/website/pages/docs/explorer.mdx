The [explorer](https://explorer.gamba.so) serves as a comprehensive tracker for games played across diverse frontends, offering both evidence and methods for verification.

Players typically initiate games through a [frontend application](/docs/apps). Once initiated, the Gamba on-chain Program undertakes validation procedures to ensure fair play, preventing any unfair advantages for the player. Subsequently, a random number is generated to determine the winner, whether it be the player or the [liquidity pool](/docs/pools) they are engaged with.
