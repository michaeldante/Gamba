# ðŸŽ° Apps

Gamba Apps/Platforms are frontends that interract with the Gamba on-chain Program, typically by allowing users to play betting games.

Owners can earn revenue by having a Solana address attached to each play occuring on their App (known as a "creator address"). This means that they can make use of Gambas liqudity across various tokens, earn fees on plays, all without risking a dime of their own.

A simple webpage is all that's needed to host a betting app like a game or a casino. No backend deployments are necessary.
