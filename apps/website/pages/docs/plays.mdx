# üé≤ Plays

Plays, or bets, are instructions made by the Player to the Gamba on-chain program typically via a frontend App. As long as the bet is fair the Program will allow it, and a random number will be generated to execute it.

## Structure

The key components that make up a play are the following:

`pool` - The pool (and its underlying token) that will be used for the play.

`wager` - The amount of the underlying token to wager.

`bet` - A list of potential outcomes. Explained below:

## Outcomes

The `bet` consists of potential multipliers.

After a play instruction has been sent, a single number from the `bet` list will be picked, and that number will be multiplied by the wagered amount to determine how many tokens the player should receive.

For instance, we can simulate a coin toss by proposing a bet with `[2, 0]` (2x or 0x).

We can create arrays of different lengths and values to simulate more complex games. As long as the program deems the bet fair, that it doesn't put the player at an unfair advantage, it will be allowed. Examples:

* [0, 2] equal odds = allowed ‚úÖ
* [1.5, .5] equal odds = allowed ‚úÖ
* [0, 0, 0, 4] equal odds = allowed ‚úÖ
* [0, 3] player has an edge = not allowed ‚ùå

In other words, the expected value should be no higher than 1.0!

With these simple rules, and a bit of UI magic, we can create a wide range of classic arcade games, like Roulette, Plinko, Crash, and more.

## How is the outcome determined

Every result on Gamba are fairly determined using the following variables:

```
rng_seed - provided by Gamba's "RNG Provider"
client_seed - provided by your browser and adjusted by you
nonce - A number that increases with each bet you make
```

Prior to playing, you will receive an encrypted hash of the `rng_seed`. Since you get it in advance, Gamba cannot change it later. However it is encrypted, so you cannot calculate your own roll results in advance (only afterwards once you get the unhashed rng_seed.)

Most frontends will allow you to set a client seed before you play. This way you can make sure Gamba does not know your clientseed in advance.

The Gamba explorer tracks every single play made via every frontend, and provides the proof and ways to verify them.
