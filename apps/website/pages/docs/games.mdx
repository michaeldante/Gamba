# üé≤ Games

Games are initiated by the player, typically via a [frontend app](/docs/apps). The Gamba on-chain Program will validate each game, making sure the player doesn't have an unfair advantage. A random number will then be generated to determine the winner. (Either the player or the [liquidity pool](/docs/pools) being played against).

## Structure

The key components that make up a game are the following:

`pool` - The pool (and its underlying token) that will be used for the game.

`wager` - The amount of tokens that the player will pay to start the game.

`bet` - A list of potential outcomes (Multipliers). Explained below:

## Outcomes

The `bet` consists of potential multipliers.

After a game has been initiated, a single number from the `bet` list will be selected at random, and that number will be multiplied by the wagered amount to determine how many tokens the player will receive.

For instance, we can simulate a coin toss by creating a bet with `[2, 0]` (Meaning 2x or 0x).

We can create arrays of different lengths and values to simulate more complex games. As long as the bet is fair it will be allowed. Examples:

* [0, 2] equal odds = allowed ‚úÖ
* [1.5, .5] equal odds = allowed ‚úÖ
* [0, 0, 0, 6] player has an advantage = not allowed ‚ùå
* [0, 3] player has an advantage = not allowed ‚ùå

With these simple rules, and a bit of UI design, we can create a wide variety of classic arcade games, like Roulette, Plinko, Crash, and more.

## How is the outcome determined

Every result on Gamba are fairly determined using the following variables:

```
rng_seed - provided by Gamba's "RNG Provider"
client_seed - provided by your browser and adjusted by you
nonce - A number that increases with each bet you make
```

Prior to initiating a game, the player receive an encrypted hash of the `rng_seed`. Since they know the hash in advance, they know that Gamba cannot change it. Meanwhile, the player can change their `client_seed` via the frontend they're playing on, which will alter the games result. When a game is finished, the player will once again receive the hashed `rng_seed` for their next game.

The [explorer](https://explorer.gamba.so) tracks games played via various frontends, and provides the proof and ways to verify them.
