# üè¶ Pools

Gamba liquidity pools act as the foundation for bets placed by players through various [frontend apps](/docs/apps), resembling the house in a traditional casino. However, unlike a traditional setup, Gamba offers the advantage of inclusivity, allowing anyone to participate and share in the profits.

## Creating a Pool

Creating a Gamba pool for any custom Solana token is a straightforward process, accessible via the explorer UI or by depositing into an existing pool. Moreover, pools can be effortlessly managed and interacted with through the Gamba SDK.

## LP Token

Upon creation of a pool for a specific token (referred to as the pool's "underlying token"), a corresponding LP token is generated. These LP tokens are minted through deposits, with initial deposits establishing an LP token ratio of 1:1 to the underlying token. However, this ratio dynamically adjusts over time as player activity influences the pool's total liquidity.

Changes in liquidity, driven by player wins or losses, directly impact the LP token's ratio to the underlying token (price). Consequently, this ratio dictates the quantity of LP tokens minted for liquidity providers upon deposit and the tokens redeemed upon withdrawal. In essence, as players incur losses, liquidity providers benefit from an increased LP ratio.

## Bonuses

Every pool is accompanied by a Bonus token, which players can utilize for free plays or discounts. These Bonus tokens are minted by any participant in exchange for the pool's underlying token. However, Bonus tokens cannot be exchanged back; they are exclusively utilized for betting against the pool. In the event of a win, the underlying tokens from the Bonus fund are awarded to the player, while losses contribute to the primary liquidity fund, effectively burning the Bonus tokens used.

90% of the underlying tokens utilized for minting Bonus tokens are allocated to a separate fund, exclusively accessible to players utilizing associated Bonus tokens. The remaining 10% are directed to the jackpot pool, detailed below.

## Jackpot

Each pool features a dedicated jackpot fund. Fees accumulated from failed jackpot attempts contribute to this fund, incrementally enhancing the potential payout until a successful win.

Upon jackpot victory, a portion of the player's winnings is reinvested into the liquidity pool's primary fund.

While participation in the jackpot is optional, [frontend apps](/docs/apps) have the flexibility to configure it as desired, including setting it to 0.

## Fees & Max Payout

## Private Pools

Private pools operate similarly to public ones but provide owners with extensive configuration options, such as fees, maximum potential payout, and more.
