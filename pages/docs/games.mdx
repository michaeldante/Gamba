# üé≤ Games

Games are initiated by the player, typically via a [frontend app](/docs/apps). The Gamba on-chain Program will validate each game, ensuring fair play. A random number will then be generated to determine the winner, whether it's the player or the [liquidity pool](/docs/pools) being played against.

## Structure

The key components that make up a game are the following:

- `pool` - The pool (and its underlying token) used for the game.
- `wager` - The amount of tokens that the player will pay to start the game.
- `rng_seed` - A cryptographic hash (SHA-256) supplied by Gamba's RNG Provider.
- `client_seed` - An adjustable, random user seed generated by your browser.
- `nonce` - A unique, sequential number incremented per bet to ensure a one-time cryptographic hash.
- `bet_array` - A set of predefined multipliers per game. The RNG selects a `resultIndex` to multiply the wager and calculate the player's resulting token payout.

Each result on Gamba is fairly, transparently and securely determined using the variables.

Prior to initiating a game, the player receive an encrypted hash of the `rng_seed`. Since they know the hash in advance, they know that Gamba cannot change it. Meanwhile, the player can change their `client_seed` via the frontend they're playing on, which will alter the games result. When a game is finished, the player will once again receive the hashed `rng_seed` for their next game.

## Outcomes

The `bet` is made up of potential multipliers.

After the game begins, the RNG selects a random number from the `bet_array`, and that number multiplies the player's `wager` to determine the final payout.

**Example of Simple Bets:**

- `[2, 0]`: This simulates a coin toss, where a player either doubles their wager (`2x`) or loses it all (`0x`).

**Examples of Different Bets:**

- `[0, 2]` - Fair bet with equal odds = allowed ‚úÖ
- `[1.5, 0.5]` - Fair bet with equal odds = allowed ‚úÖ
- `[0, 0, 0, 0, 5]` - Fair bet with varied odds = allowed ‚úÖ
- `[0, 0, 0, 6]` - Player advantage = not allowed ‚ùå
- `[0, 3]` - Player advantage = not allowed ‚ùå

With simple rules and effective UI design, various arcade-style games like Roulette, Plinko, Crash, and others can be built using the available components.

## How is the outcome determined

<Steps>
### User Places Bet
The user places a bet using any Gamba [platform](/docs/apps).

### Gamba Runs RNG and Returns Result

Gamba programs process the bet using on-chain RNG, which selects a resultIndex that corresponds to one of the predefined multipliers in the bet_array.

### End Game & Payout Multiplier

Gamba returns the result to the frontend and credits the player if a payout is due.
